# VGG Gender and Age Classification

Using conv network to classify gender and age.

In paper [Age and Gender Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks](https://www.openu.ac.il/home/hassner/projects/cnn_agegender/CNN_AgeGenderEstimation.pdf), author come up a model of conv netowrk to estimate gender and age.

I reproduce their work in tensorflow and make some improvment.

Dataset: [Adience Benchmark](https://www.openu.ac.il/home/hassner/Adience/data.html#agegender). About 20k images, 2 categories in gender, 8 categories in age.

```

## Experiments

1. reproduce their work(called model_origin later)
2. using other networks, such as inception-like, resnet-like
3. using bathnormalization, change activation function
4. using pre-trained VGG face network and fine tune fully connected layers

model_origin get **85.9%** accuracy in gender and **49.5%** in age.

Replacing the model_origin with inception-like/resnet-like netowork don't get significant improvement. Using selu as the activation function can get **2% improvement** in gender estimation.

VGG face network is a network for face recogniton, I use it as a face feature extractor. It is a good base model. Using pre-trained conv layers of VGG face network and fine-tuning fully connected layers gets **91%** accuracy in gender and **55%** in age.

You get get pre-trained VGG face network weight [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1swNHi9XMh0GJs8eBEhw2xjCAN07JjfT9/view?usp=sharing)

## Others

Multi-cropping can get a little improvement but consuming more time.
